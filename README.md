# TaCZ Enchantments Overhaul
Mod that adds enchantments for Timeless and Classic Zero guns as well as adding compatibility with other enchantments.

## New Enchantments
Adds 5 new enchantments for TaCZ guns.
- **Bullseye**: 50% more headshot damage per level.
- **Deep Impact**: 5% more armour penetration per level.
- **Firepower**: 10% more bullet damage per level.
- **Precision**: 5% more accuracy per level.
- **Punch Through**: +1 bullet penetration per level.

All enchantment effects can be configured in the config which is accessible in-game via the mod settings menu, or
by altering the `tacz_enchantments_overhaul.json5` file in the `config` folder. Additionally, the enchantment level
spans can be configured allowing for more fine-tuned balancing of when and where the enchantments are available.

## Enchantment Whitelisting
The mod also allows you to whitelist specific guns for specified enchantments. This means you can have certain 
enchantments only be available for specific guns, by default all enchantments are available for all guns. 
This is also configurable in the config file.

### Looting Compat
The looting enchantment is also supported by the mod, and is whitelisted by default for all guns.
